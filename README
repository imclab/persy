persy -- sync tool based on Git
=================================
Since persy builds upon the infrastructure offered by Git, it shares its main
strengths:
* speed: recovering your data is faster that cp -a...
* full revision history
* space-efficient data store, with file compression and textual/binary deltas
* efficient transport protocol to replicate the backup (faster than rsync)

Dependencies
============
persy needs the following software at run-time:
* git
* python-pyinotify - to get efficient information about filesystem changes
* python-paramiko - ssh library to initialize a remote server

Installation
============
persy can be used just to backup your data or sync your data with multiple machines.
persy is designed to run by its own on the computer or in an environment with at least one server in reach of every computer with synced files.


Usage
=====
The normal local workflow is:
 $ persy --config --username=USERNAME     #username used for the commits
 $ persy --config --useremail=USERERMAIL  #useremail used for the commits
 $ persy --initlocal                      # run once to initialize the backup system
 $ persy --add_dir=DIR                    # DIR is the absolute path to a directory in /home/user. The directory is then integrated in persy
 $ persy                                  # starts the persy daemon

The normal workflow with a remote Server and an already initialized local repository is:
 $ persy --config --hostname=SERVER       # SERVER = location of the server
 $ persy --config --path=PATH             # PATH = path of the gitrepository on the server (path will be created if it does not exist)
 $ persy --initRemote                     # created a bare git repository on the server in PATH
 $ persy                                  # starts the persy daemon


The normal workflow with a already initialized remote Server and no local repository. 
 $ persy --config --hostname=SERVER       # SERVER = location of the server
 $ persy --config --path=PATH             # PATH = path of the gitrepository on the server (path will be created if it does not exist)
 $
 persy --syncwithRemote                 # connects to the remote server and pulls the files from the git repository
 $ persy                                  # starts the persy daemon
